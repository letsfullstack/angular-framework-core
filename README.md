Updates
=====

Made a modification? Test it at least in one project before submiting a version. It still needs unit testing and CI with projects. After everything seems perfectly up-to-date, run the following steps:

1\. Commit and push your updates using Let's Bitbucket credentials

2\. Change and commit a new tag version (always check and update the last version here and in package.json):

```bash
$ git tag -a vX.X.X -m "version_message"
```

3\. Push the new tag version to remote repository:

```bash
$ git push origin vX.X.X  # Version needs to be the same from commit
```

4\. Run npm installation with the newest version:

```bash
  npm install --save git+ssh://git@bitbucket.org/letscomunicadev/angular-framework-core.git#vX.X.X
```
